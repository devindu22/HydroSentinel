# HydroSentinel

The HydroSentinel Project represents a futuristic application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in controlled-environment agriculture, specifically conceptualized for NASA’s Artemis colonization programme. As future missions envision establishing semi-autonomous habitats on Mars, food production within pressurized eco-domes will be a critical factor for human survival. This project focuses on building an intelligent, self-regulating irrigation system capable of maintaining soil moisture levels automatically, ensuring optimal crop growth in Martian farm domes where human labor and resources are limited.

HydroSentinel is designed to function as a real-time soil sensing and irrigation control system. It integrates a distributed network of soil moisture sensors connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller, transmitting data through Node-RED to a Blynk IoT cloud dashboard. When soil moisture levels drop below the configured threshold, the system autonomously activates a water pump through a relay module. A manual override option is available on the dashboard for direct control, while all data readings and system states are logged in real time for long-term crop optimization.

The HydroSentinel system also demonstrates how IoT AFTHA components of Architecture, Frameworks, Tools, Hardware, and APIs can be integrated to create scalable, energy-efficient, and autonomous smart farming systems. Although designed for a Mars mission scenario, the same concept applies to Earth-based agriculture, particularly precision irrigation in greenhouses and hydroponic farms.
